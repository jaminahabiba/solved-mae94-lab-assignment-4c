Download the part file “<em>Detergent Bottle Starting Point.sldprt</em>” (also posted on CCLE) and follow the “Walkthrough” tutorials to create the Detergent Bottle.

This assignment is all about using “Surface” features, which may be a bit challenging compared with previous modeling tasks. Save your work after every tutorial.

If you find that a particular feature will not sweep correctly, it is often best to start over again. Do not forget to save your work frequently.

Engrave your name (and logo – if you wish to add one) on the face of the detergent bottle and upload the part file (<em>LastName_DetergentBottle.sldrprt</em>) to CCLE Lab-4C.
